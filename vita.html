Software Systems

\fISCROLL\fP.
SCROLL is a graphics language and plotting system
for producing publication-quality graphs.
The system is a substantially enhanced version
of the original system developed by M. Sargent III.
It has been distributed to approximately 20 sites,
mostly within the Bell System.
.LP
\fISL5\fP.
SL5 is a high-level, general-purpose
programming language developed for experimental research
in generalized pattern matching and control regimes.
The system, which was designed for flexibility and
generality in order to support research applications,
has been distributed to approximately 10 sites.
SL5 was developed in collaboration with R. E. Griswold.
.LP
\fIIcon\fP.
Icon is a successor to SL5, but is intended to replace
SNOBOL4 and SL5 for nonnumeric applications.
The portable implementation is designed for user
rather than research applications.
It has been distributed to nearly 60 sites.
Icon was developed in collaboration with R. E. Griswold.
.LP
\fIRatfor\fP.
Ratfor is a substantially enhanced
version of the Ratfor preprocessor for Fortran originally
developed by B. W. Kernighan.
This version has become the \fIad hoc\fP standard Ratfor
and has been distributed to nearly 100 sites.
.LP
\fISoftware Tools\fP.
Enhanced versions of the tools described in
\fISoftware Tools\fP by B. W. Kernighan and P. L. Plauger.
Also include are
over 30 new tools, a machine-independent i/o system,
and machine-specific i/o systems for the DEC-10 and
the Cyber.
There have been three releases of this software
and the latest, released in late 1981,
has become the \fIad hoc\fP standard
software tools distribution
and has been distributed to over 200 sites.
.LP
\fIY\fP.
\s-2Y\s0 is a mid-level, general-purpose
programming language developed as a replacement for
Ratfor in courses based on \fISoftware Tools\fP
and for experimental research in compiler design and code generation.
It is syntactically similar to Ratfor and semantically similar to C.
The compiler is designed to be portable and has been installed
on at least three computers.
The system has been distributed to approximately 25 sites.
